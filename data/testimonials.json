    "text": "Andrew, has been critical in making our FreightWise iOS & Android app a success. It is really cool to see how well this app is designed, functions we support, and most importantly the potential it has for growth. Further, Andrew is one that always truly thinks about the problem and has repeatedly impressed all of us by finding elegant solutions to very difficult problems. I generally try and read most all of the teams' code commits but probably enjoy reading his contributions to our technology stack the best :)"
